1. JavaScript is a _________ or programming language that allows you to implement _______ things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display ______ information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, ________ 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

### Questions

7. What is one of the hardest things to learn in programming? What does it involve (in your own words)? What does it require?

8. *Finish the sentence by quoting the article:* The more you code... 

9. *True or False* - The application process is only for apps and can never be applied to anything.

10. Once you’ve planned out the content of a simple webpage, what is the next logical step in your own words?

11. Summarize the five steps of planning a simple website in your own words.

### Answers

Example Answer: animation, static

1. Scripting, complex, static, animated

2. Markup, language, structure, meaning, page

3. Style, rules, colors, fonts, layout, out, content

4. Dynamically, animate, lines

5. Process, wireframe, code, distribute

6. Schools, Stack, Developer

7. One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer — this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do, working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together. This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice — plus a bit of creativity.

8. ...The better you’ll get at it.

9. False

10. The next logical step is to try to work out what content you want to put on a whole website, what pages you need, and how they should be arranged and link to one another for the best possible user experience. This is called Information architecture. In a large, complex website, a lot of planning can go into this process, but for a simple website of a few pages this can be fairly simple, and fun!

11. (1) Bear in mind that you’ll have a few elements common to most (if not all) pages — such as the navigation menu, and the footer content. If your site is for a business, for example, it’s a good idea to have your contact information available in the footer on each page. Note down what you want to have common to every page. (2) Next, draw a rough sketch of what you might want the structure of each page to look like (it might look like our simple website above.) Note what each block is going to be. (3) Now, brainstorm all the other (not common to every page) content you want to have on your website — write a big list down. (4) Next, try to sort all these content items into groups, to give you an idea of what parts might live together on different pages. This is very similar to a technique called Card sorting. (5) Now try to sketch a rough sitemap — have a bubble for each page on your site, and draw lines to show the typical workflow between pages. The homepage will probably be in the center, and link to most if not all of the others; most of the pages in a small site should be available from the main navigation, although there are exceptions. You might also want to include notes about how things might be presented.
